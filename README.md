# Buttchugger

A shitty script that shoves files from one Telegram channel to another like it doesn’t give a single flying fuck.  
You want chaos? You got it. You want memes? I got 50/50 chance of trolling every caption. 
You want control? Lol. Lmao, even.

## Features
- Multi-source → multi-target forwarding, because I don’t do subtle
- Media selection: docs, photos, videos, audio, or everything (pick your poison)
- Caption trolling: 50/50 chance to append or straight-up replace captions with random memes
- Crash-resume support
- Logs every forward so you can cry about it
- Randomized sleep timers to ensure maximum butthurt from Telegram

## Requirements
Python 3.9+ (obviously)  
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
